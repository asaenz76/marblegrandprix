  // across app-switches instead of reloading it, so a client left open
  // across a deploy kept running old JS whose Server Action IDs no longer
  // matched the server, hanging login indefinitely — compounded by iOS
  // Safari's service worker implementation adding real per-request latency
  // just from having any active service worker in scope. No longer worth
  // it for what was a nice-to-have. This actively unregisters any
  // service worker + clears any cache a returning visitor's browser still
  // has from before, rather than waiting on public/sw.js's own (slower,
  // update-cycle-dependent) self-unregistration to reach them.
